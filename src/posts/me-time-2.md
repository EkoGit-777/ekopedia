# Me Time! Another Movie Marathon. :popcorn:

Today I'm having anohter me time. As usual, I'm watching movie on my me time. I pick The Fantastic Four - First Step and also Omniscient Reader - The Prophet. Let's talk about those movie.

Before I watch The Fantastic Four movie, I've already watched some reviews of it. Many said that it's a comeback of Marvel. As a context, this is not the first live adaption of Fantastic Four. I've watched 4 of those up until now. Fantastic Four (2005), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), the sequel of previous movie. Fantastic Four (2015), this is a reboot of Fantastic Four. Many people said the movie is really bad. And the last one is Fantastic Four - First Step. This movie is actually another reboot. But similar to Superman, it skips the initial story of how Fantastic Four exist. They only show it as some cut scenes in the movie. This movie shows how Fantastic Four really look like. They are not super heroes, they are family first. Family of scientist who accidentally get super power. There are several actions, obviously this is super hero movie, but it's not the main course. This movie tells you about how they keep their family together, when everybody on this earth are against you. In conclusion, this is one of best family movie in 2025.

Now, let's talk about Omniscient Reader - The Prophet. When the trailer was released, I watched it and decided that I would definitely gonna watch the movie. For everyone who didn't know the reference, this movie is based on webtoon comic with title Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, or some people called ORV. I've been reading this manhwa (Korean comic) for long time. And after Solo Leveling get anime adaptation, I can't wait for this manhwa getting one too. Turns out, it gets live action adaption, which is even better. The trailer looks promising. But after watching the movie, I'm disappointed. Why?

How can you justify that changes? That character is dokkaebi, or goblin in english. The left one is in manhwa, the right one is live action version. As you can see, there is huge difference in design. When I see Bihyung (the name of that Dokkaebi), I was in shock and scream in my mind "what the hell is that labubu doing in the movie!!??". For reference, Labubu is a doll.

See the resemblance? I don't mind of changing the story to fit in the movie. I don't mind using actors and actresses that not similar to the source. But changing the design of fictional character, which you can make it with the help of computer, that's unacceptable! There was once happen in Sonic live action adaptation too. On first Sonic movie, the design of Sonic in the trailer was really bad. After getting many critics, they decided to refine the design and they made it better. I didn't see Bihyung appearance in the trailer. I saw the ichthyosaurus, the first monster in the first scenario. And it looks good. Why did they make dokkaebi like a stuffed animal? As an ORV fans, I would like to recommend the movie, but in the other hand I don't think this is good live adaptation. So, decide it on your own.
