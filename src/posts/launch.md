# My personal portfolio web is done! :tada:

I never thought that I would finish my personal web. lol....
I subscribe to this domain since last year, but never start to do it. Because I'm too lazy to make whole website. Thanks to chatgpt that has suggested me to use VuePress to make static webpage. Turns out it's really fun using VuePress to make this. If only I know about VuePress earlier, I would have done make my personal portfolio web. :sweat_smile:
