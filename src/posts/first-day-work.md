# First Day Working Remotely

Today was my first day working remotely as a Software Engineer. I was using Ruby on Rails on the project I was working on. Since I never used Ruby on Rails before, except when doing test for applying to this job, I had to meet several challenges. My task was familiarize with the project and also update unit test and the documentation. As a developer who used Laravel for several years, I didn't have any issue understanding about the structure and some concept that was used in Ruby on Rails. But there are several differences that often made me misunderstand about the code. For example, in Laravel factory, the key was always the column name of the table. But in Ruby on Rails, turns out it's not always. :sweat_smile:

Even though it was not as smooth as I hope, I could tackle it and succeed fixing some of the unit tests. Thanks to chatgpt, I could understand more about Ruby on Rails. It even made me a mental map for migrating from Laravel to Ruby on Rails. :star_struck:
