I never thought I’d get the chance to be interviewed directly by foreign recruiters. But today, it finally happened — and it turned out to be one of the most nerve-wracking yet exciting experiences of my career.

## How It Started

October 9th, I applied to a job vacancy for a Senior Fullstack PHP Developer position on Jobstreet. My first focus was on the salary range mentioned in the description — IDR 16–24 million! It was more than double what I’d ever seen for a similar position on Jobstreet.

When I opened the detailed page and read the full description and requirements, I was even more surprised. There was no maximum age limit, and no minimum degree requirement. I knew it would be tough — the salary was more than twice my previous job in Jakarta — but I thought, “Why not try? I have nothing to lose.” :star_struck:

The same day I applied, I received an email from Jobstreet saying that the recruiter had sent me a message. They invited me to join a video interview where I’d need to answer a few questions in video format. Since it was already evening when I read the email, I decided to record my answers the next day.

The next day, I completed the video interview. I was given three questions about how senior developers make decisions when facing certain problems. Not long after that, I received another email — another video interview invitation! Again, I decided to do it the next day.

On October 11th, I did the second interview. This time, I was given two questions about technical decisions and reviewing mistakes in code. A few hours later, another email arrived — but this one was different. It was an invitation for a face-to-face interview on Monday, October 13th. I immediately agreed to the schedule.

## The Interview

When I read the recruiter’s name, I immediately knew he wasn’t Indonesian. I prepared my introduction in English and rehearsed a few possible questions. Ten minutes before the scheduled time, I installed the Microsoft Teams desktop app.

But just before joining, I ran into a problem — my camera wasn’t working. :sweat_smile: While I was still trying to fix the configuration, the recruiter let me into the conference. I apologized and asked if he could wait a few minutes while I tried to fix the issue. He said I could come back after setting up the camera.

Realizing there was no quick solution, I decided to use the browser version instead. Thankfully, it worked perfectly, and I continued the interview there.

As expected, he asked me to introduce myself. What I didn’t expect was for him to ask what I did after graduating from college. I explained that I didn’t finish college because of COVID — I chose to stop and focus on working instead. After that, the conversation flowed naturally, just as I’d prepared.

Then he asked about my strengths and weaknesses. I had prepared answers for that question before, but for a different job. So I was caught a little off guard — this was the only question I wish I could’ve answered differently. :sob:

## The Review

That was my first time having a long conversation in English with a foreigner. I’ve been interviewed in English before, but always by Indonesian people. This felt completely different because I couldn’t think in Indonesian first — it would’ve been pointless!

I was honestly amazed at myself for being able to do it. I know my listening and speaking skills aren’t as strong as my reading and writing, but I managed to keep up and express myself clearly.

There was also something interesting about the salary discussion. As I mentioned before, the listed range was IDR 16–24 million. On Jobstreet, recruiters can ask follow-up questions to applicants. One of them was: “What’s your expected salary?”

I was puzzled. The answers were multiple-choice, starting from 3 million and increasing by 1 million each option. But after 10 million, the increments jumped by 5 million. So the only option within the range was 20 million — which felt too high. I couldn’t justify that number, so I selected 10 million instead.

During the interview, the recruiter asked if that amount was enough to live in Jakarta. Well... I can live on less than that — 10 million is still more than I used to earn. But now that I think about it, maybe I should’ve chosen at least 15 million. :money_mouth_face:

That interview wasn’t just about a job — it was a milestone. I proved to myself that I could communicate confidently in English, even with foreign recruiters. Whether or not I get the job, this experience already pushed me one step closer to my dream of working on a global stage.
