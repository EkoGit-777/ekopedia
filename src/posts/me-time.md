# Me Time! Movie Marathon. :popcorn:

Today I'm having me time. I'm often watching movie on my me time. Fortunately, this month has many good movies. Superman, Jurassic World, Doraemon, Crayon Shin-Chan, etc. I pick Superman and Jurassic World for today's entertainment. There are already many reviews of Superman up until today, good reviews especially. In my opinion, it's quite good. It's nice to see same character played by different actor and makes different persona. In this movie, Clark Kent or Superman is portrayed very humanely. A little bit naive and idealistic.

When I see justice gang (Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Mr Fantastic), honestly I have no idea how DCU will go forward. At first I had big hope after watching Zack Snyder's Justice League. Because I thought the Justice League franchise would start moving forward. But after this Superman, I can't imagine how would the Justice League be like. Of course I hope it will be better. Honestly, I don't care about the Justice League. I just want Injustice universe will be made into live adaptation. :rofl:
