After I passed the interview I shared in my previous post, I finally started my first week with a foreign company.  
This was my first time working directly under a foreign director — and to be honest, I was both excited and nervous.  

I didn’t know what to expect — whether the communication would be strict or flexible, whether they’d understand the working habits we usually have here in Indonesia.  
But that’s what made it interesting.

## 🪩 The Onboarding Experience

I met my director in Jakarta. The onboarding process was quite simple — the main goal was to help me set up the project on my device.
I was introduced to their internal tools — Microsoft Teams, Docker, and VirtualBox — got access to the repositories, and received my first small task: setting up the environment.

What stood out to me was how clearly everything was explained. The director didn’t assume I already knew everything, but also didn’t treat me like a beginner. There was a nice balance of professionalism and trust.

They really value **asynchronous communication**, meaning everything must be clear and well-documented in writing.
That was a new habit for me, since most local teams tend to rely more on quick chats or verbal explanations.

## 🌏 How Foreign Companies Recruit Indonesian Developers

During onboarding, I started to notice how foreign companies think when hiring Indonesian developers.  
It’s not just about skill — they’re looking for people who can **communicate ideas clearly**, take initiative, and understand context without needing to be micromanaged.

They see Indonesian developers as skilled, dedicated, and flexible — but sometimes lacking confidence in communication.  

In my conversation with the director, he mentioned that many applicants actually have great portfolios but struggle to express their thought process clearly during interviews — especially in video interviews.
Some don’t check their audio quality before recording, while others don’t use English at all, even though the instructions clearly state that all answers must be in English.
And the most common mistake they make is submitting a CV written entirely in Indonesian language.

One rule I always follow when applying for jobs is this: **write your CV and cover letter in the same language used in the job posting**.

That’s where many miss the opportunity.

## ⚠️ Common Problems in Recruiting Indonesian Developers

There are several things that often cause friction between foreign companies and Indonesian candidates:

- **Language barrier** — some developers can write good English but freeze in conversation.  
- **Cultural gap** — we’re used to being “yes” people, while they prefer honest opinions and feedback.  
- **Unclear expectations** — many candidates don’t ask enough questions about the role or project.  
- **Time zone discipline** — being late to a meeting (even just five minutes) can affect how they perceive reliability.
- **Unrealistic demands** — asking for salaries that don’t match our skills or experience often gives a negative impression, no matter how confident we sound.

It’s not that foreign directors don’t understand cultural differences — they actually try to.  
But what they need most is clarity and accountability.

I realized that if you can communicate well, even in simple English, and show consistency, they’ll value you highly.

## 💻 My First Week Working with a Foreign Director

My first week felt like diving into a new world.
The director personally welcomed me in our first meeting — casual but sharp. He walked me through how the team operates, their principles, and how they measure success.
It was very outcome-focused — not just a “finish your task” kind of mindset.

On the second day, I received my first assignment: fixing a bug and checking an unoptimized code issue.
It wasn’t too hard technically, but I had to explain why I did each step.

That forced me to think more structurally — not just about coding, but also about communicating the logic behind it.

By the end of the week, I started to feel comfortable.
The time zone difference wasn’t too bad, and I was beginning to adapt to their workflow.

The most memorable moment was when I said goodbye after meeting the director in Jakarta. He casually said,

> “I'm not a scary person, right?”

That small line really boosted my confidence and made me genuinely happy.
I feel blessed to be part of this company. :blush:

## 🧠 Lessons Learned from My First Week

Working with a foreign director in that first week taught me a few important things:

1. **Clarity is power** — write clearly, think clearly, and explain clearly.  
2. **Confidence matters** — it’s okay to ask questions or give feedback. They actually appreciate it.  
3. **Professionalism is universal** — showing up on time, delivering what you promise, and being consistent goes a long way.  
4. **Cultural difference isn’t a barrier** — it’s an opportunity to learn how other people think and work.

## ✨ Conclusion: What I Learned from Global Collaboration

That first week was full of learning and small breakthroughs.
It completely changed how I see global collaboration.

It’s not just about getting paid more than usual — it’s about growing as a professional and understanding how people from different countries build trust and teamwork.

This experience gave me a new appreciation for how Indonesian developers can truly shine internationally — as long as we prepare not only technically, but also mentally and communicatively.
