# One of The Best Live Adaptaion Movie of Game

There are many adaptation movies of games. Like Super Mario, Sonic, and also the latest one is Minecraft. Even though there are many, but only few that can be considered the best adaptation movie. The Exit 8 is one of them.

The Exit 8 is an indie game where you are trapped in an endless underground passageway. You have to observe your surroundings carefully to reach "The Exit 8". There are 4 rules you need to follow if you want to complete the game.

- Don't overlook any anomalies.
- If you find anomalies, turn back immediately.
- If you don't find anomalies, do not turn back.
- To go out from Exit 8.

The Exit 8 is a short walking simulator inspired by Japanese underground passageways, liminal spaces and back rooms. The game is only available in Japanese and English, but if you understand the above description of the anomaly, you can probably play it all the way through. You can buy the game in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2653790/The_Exit_8/)

What makes The Exit 8 is one of the best adaptation, there are several reasons of it.

## The Story

The game itself has no story whatsoever. But in the movie, there is a story that audience can follow. The objective of the game is still there. But the story makes it richer. Even though most of them are a metaphor, but still it makes the movie interesting.

## The Reference

I personally haven't played the game yet, but I have watched the gameplay in YouTube. I don't know how accurate the anomaly compared to the game. But I know some of it from the gameplay that I watched before. Not only about the anomaly reference, but also the gameplay itself. The director have successfully transformed the gameplay into the game. If you play the game, maybe you only want to complete it as soon as possible. When you realize there is anomaly, you will go back as soon as possible. But sometimes, there are some players that have bigger curiosity. Trying to check the anomaly closely. And maybe even wait for the surprise. That's also what the main character did in the movie. Also, there are some points where the main character missed the anomaly and have to repeat it again from number zero.

## The Experience

On previous point I mention that not only the anomaly reference, but also the gameplay reference is successfully transformed into the movie. It makes you as the audience, can experience as the main character in the gamee. Especially the first person shoot at the beginning of the movie. Because in the game you can play in first person shooter camera angle.

Even though there are many positive things about this movie, this movie is still not perfect.There are some flaws the move have such as repetitive scene that can make it little bit boring (the game itself  is also like that). And also in the beginning part where the main character still doesn'e aware about the loop, he is repeating in number zero for several times. I don't know if all of it have anomaly or not, but I'm sure at least 1 or 2 that has no anomaly in it. So he should be at least reach number one even though he have to repeat to number zero after that.
