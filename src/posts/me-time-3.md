# Long Holiday Equals to Movie Marathon! :popcorn:

I got 4 holidays from December 25th to 28th, I spent it with watching some movies. I watched "Agak Laen" on December 25th. Then I watched "SpongeBob The Movie" and "Avatar 3" on the day after that.

I don't have much to say about SpongeBob The Movie because for me, it's not as good as previous movie. In my opinion, it's just cartoon movie for kids. No important story, with some songs, very colorful. I don't get the same vibe like previous movies. On the other hand, I have so many things to say about other 2 movies.

"Agak Laen" is an IP that have many franchise with various form. Movie is one of them. This is the second movie, but it's not related each other. They made the movie franchise like Warkop Movie. While the main characters are always same people, the stories are always different. The first movie of "Agak Laen" has become the most successful comedy movie in indonesia with more than 9 Millions viewers. On the day I write this article, the viewers of "Agak Laen- Menyala Pantiku" has reached 10 Millions. It means that the second movie become more successfull than the first.

I'm sure some people would think it's just because the hype of the first movie. While it's true, but it's not just the main reason. If we rule out the first week viewers, which they may only watched because the hype, the numbers after that are still increase daily. Also, many reviewers give good ratings on this movie. So, the argument the movie has many viewers because of the hype is not valid.

For me personally, what I like about the movie is the script. I want to say that the one who wrote the script is really genius! In my opnion, this movie is not comedy movie. But it's detective story with "whodunit" formula. The comedy is only side dish. But, every punch line are very on point. The story itself is solid, with strong comedy as accessories here and there, makes the movie very fun.

I mentioned before that "Agak Laen" has many form of franchise, one of it is podcast. As "Agak Laen" podcast listener, you will get some fan service in the form of comedy because you get the reference from the podcast. It's like a bonus when you also follow them in their other franchise.

Now let's talk about Avatar. This Avatar Movie is actually the third movie, or second sequel. The story continue after the last movie event happened. So, it's very recommended to watch previous movie if you want to watch this movie. The movie is about 3 hours long, so prepare you bladder before watching it.

I watch the 3D version, and I really recommend you to watch it in 3D. For me, the 3D is really enchanced than previous one. The story itself is really good. If I can draw it in graph, the hype is increase steadily from start to end. And the climax battle is really amazing. I got the same feeling like watching End Game or one of battle in Lord of The Ring. At first the protagonist side seems have the upper hand. Then the enemy turn the tide. And last, the battle between main protagonist and main antagonist. The movie ends with happy ending. I'm not sure if there will be any sequel or not. But I'm satisfied with the ending of the franchise with this movie.
