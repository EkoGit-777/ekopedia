# Long Holiday Equals to Movie Marathon! :popcorn:


I had four days off from December 25th to 28th, and I spent them watching movies.
On December 25th, I watched “**Agak Laen**” The day after that, I watched “**SpongeBob The Movie**” and “**Avatar 3**”.

I don’t have much to say about *SpongeBob The Movie* because, for me, it’s not as good as the previous ones. In my opinion, it’s just a cartoon movie for kids — no strong story, a lot of songs, and very colorful visuals. I didn’t get the same vibe as I did from the earlier SpongeBob movies.
On the other hand, I have a lot to say about the other two movies.

“**Agak Laen**” is an IP that has expanded into multiple franchises in various forms, and movies are one of them. This is their second movie, but it’s not directly related to the first one. They treat the movie franchise similarly to Warkop movies: the main characters are played by the same people, but the stories are always different.

The first *Agak Laen* movie became the most successful comedy movie in Indonesia, with more than 9 million viewers. At the time I’m writing this article, *Agak Laen: Menyala Pantiku* has already reached 10 million viewers. That means the second movie is even more successful than the first.

Some people might think this success is purely because of the hype from the first movie. While that may be partially true, it’s not the only reason. If we exclude the first-week viewers — who may have watched it just because of the hype — the audience numbers are still increasing every day. Many reviewers have also given this movie positive ratings. So the argument that the movie is popular only because of hype doesn’t really hold up.

Personally, what I love most about this movie is the script. I’d say the writer is truly a genius. In my opinion, this isn’t really a comedy movie — it’s a detective story using a *whodunit* formula. The comedy feels more like a side dish. Still, every punchline lands perfectly. The story itself is solid, and the strong comedy sprinkled throughout makes the movie incredibly fun to watch.

As I mentioned earlier, *Agak Laen* exists in many forms, and one of them is a podcast. As a listener of the *Agak Laen* podcast, you’ll get some fan service in the form of inside jokes and references. It feels like a bonus for those who follow them across different platforms.

Now, let’s talk about *Avatar*. This movie is actually the third installment (the second sequel). The story continues directly from the previous movie, so I highly recommend watching the earlier films first. The movie is about three hours long, so make sure to prepare your bladder before watching it. :sweat_smile:

I watched the 3D version, and I really recommend it. The 3D experience feels significantly improved compared to the previous movie. The story itself is great. If I were to draw it as a graph, the hype steadily increases from start to finish. The final battle is amazing — it gave me the same feeling I had when watching *Avengers: Endgame* or one of the epic battles in *The Lord of the Rings*.

At first, the protagonist’s side seems to have the upper hand. Then the enemy turns the tide. Finally, it comes down to a battle between the main protagonist and the main antagonist. The movie ends on a happy note. I’m not sure if there will be another sequel, but if this is the end of the franchise, I’m satisfied with how it concludes.
