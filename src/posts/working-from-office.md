# Working From Office Again! :briefcase:

It has been two weeks since I started working in the office in Jakarta. My first day was an amazing experience — especially being able to meet the director in person. It was also great to finally meet the team that I had only seen through online meetings on Microsoft Teams. The orientation was quite brief; we mainly discussed how the workflow would be when working from the office.

The building we rent is part of GoWork, and the facilities are really good. There is a canteen for employees with affordable prices. On Fridays, we can also pray at the mosque, which is conveniently located inside the building, near the canteen I mentioned earlier.

I feel truly blessed to be part of the Prestia team. As one of the initial members of Prestia, I hope the project will be widely accepted in Indonesia and continue to grow in the future.
