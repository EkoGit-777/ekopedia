Hi there! Welcome to dev notes section. :sunglasses:
At first, I put all of my dev notes in `posts` folder. But after some considerations, I decide that I should my this as another section in my blog.
So, here we are, special section for all of my dev notes. I started creating these note at the same time I started working remotely. And since now I'm using new stack, Ruby on Rails, most of my notes are about Ruby on Rails, for now. But I might crreate another note about another stack. Or maybe, I'm not the only one who will post dev note here, who knows? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Anyway, I hope these notes can help any of you who read this. Enjoy! :tada:
