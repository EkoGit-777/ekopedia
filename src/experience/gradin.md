## My Contributions

- My first porject was a stockopname app of one of big retail in Surabaya. This web-app can be run in offline mode, and it can connect to local server as long as the device connect on same internet connection.
- My second project was a lightweight ERP for same retail I mentioned before. This system has many features such as warehousing, purchasing, stockopname (I moved my first project here with enhanced features), and POS.
- My third project was a webpage for booking a big vehicle for delivery. This webpage then embedded on their site.
- My last project was a project management system that will be used by construction company. This project was created to meet the need for a project management system with special features such as creating record of transfers, categorizing project by special tags and categories, and also templating project and tasks for employee.

## My Journey

I was working on several projects working here. At most of projects, I used Laravel as the backend and VueJS as the frontend. At first I only handling the backend. Even though I have used Laravel before, but it's only for a while. And at the time, Laravel had been updated many times. So, my current knowledge is deprecated. I had to learn Laravel from zero again. :smiling_face_with_tear:

Luckily the documentation was well made. I didn't have any difficulties developing using Laravel on new project. After I finish the backend, I started to do the frontend. Since it was my first time using Vue, the frontend was almost done by my senior and I only need to update the configuration for the API. At that time I learned about VueJS, and little by little I made changes until finally my senior delegated me completely to the frontend. :sunglasses:

In my journey, I didn't only learn about VueJS but also about typescript. At first I was skeptical with it. But after I learned and using it in project, I was starting to enjoy it. :laughing: Until now, I alway use typescript when developing using VueJS.
