Before I start my career in IT, I went to college Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya. I didn't finish my study because I didn't finish my final project. At that time my tech stack were strongly in developing desktop app, such as Visual Basic, Java, and C#. And now, my tech stack are mostly for web developing. Even though I still use C++ or Java for teaching basic programming to my students.
