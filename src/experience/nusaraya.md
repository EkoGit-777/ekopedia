## My Contributions

- Shafira
This was my first project there. I built web-based mobile app using AngularJS and PhoneGap
- Aji Mumpung
Aji Mumpung was a reward based mobile app. I helped developing lock screen for the app and handle user issue. It was built using java as frontend android native and Laravel as backend.
- Eilhamzah
Eilhamzah was system management of umroh package. It was built using Yii framework. I helped refactoring finance features and also integrating finance report with Zahir.

## My Journey

As my first career in IT, I only had limited knowledge and experience. The knowledge I have mostly was programming language for desktop application such as C++, Java, Visual Basic. I almost have zero knowledges about web developing. When I did my first project, I learned about HTML and javascript for around 2 weeks. Most of my browser histories are from w3schools. :sweat_smile:

After I understand about HTML and javascript, it didn't take long for me to increase my working pace. When I was moved to Eilhamzah, it was another challenge for me. Luckily I have learned some about PHP when I was in Aji Mumpung team. Even though I didn't handle the backend for long, I get the gist of it. And in Eilhamzah, I learned more about MVC concept.
