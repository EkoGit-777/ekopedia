# PT Aldmic Indonesia

## About

FlowerAdvisor came about as a result of a prominent absence of a single strong brand in Asia for International Flower Delivery. Online users found it a struggle to discover a trusted 24 hour delivery flower site which can be replied upon to send flowers, hampers and gifts to their loved ones anywhere in the world.

Although there are plenty of talented local florists, most are not keen to spend millions on infrastructure to build a stable and secure site that enables and manages E-commerce transaction. to make matters worse, Asia & Europe has also one of the largest E-commerce frauds which makes many users very skeptical of small sites.

:calendar: Nov 2024 - Apr 2025

## My Contributions

- Migrate payment method from project Laravel 5.3 to Laravel 10.
- Add features for workshop to record assignment of florists for evaluation.

## My Journey

This was actually my first experience working outside Surabaya. Even though my working time was not long, I learned many things. I learned about how to handle e-commerce system. I was experiencing working with teams from many divisions.
